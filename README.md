This folder contains scripts used to generate analysis results and figures for paper "Unveiling the Gut Microbiome Network Fingerprint: A Deep Learning Approach to Predict Immunotherapy Response in Melanoma Patients."

The DNN part was adapted from DAG-DeepVASE (https://github.com/ZhenjiangFan/DAG-deepVASE) as in both _Step1_ and _Step2_.
The network analysis part was adapted from Cytoscape.

The data used for this project was downloaded from 
McCulloch, J.A., Davar, D., Rodrigues, R.R. et al. Intestinal microbiota signatures of clinical response and immune-related adverse events in melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1. Nat Med 28, 545â€“556 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01698-2

Figures in the manuscript were generated via Biorender, Cytoscape, and R.

Intermediate results are in the **Data** folder
